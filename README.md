# Shopping-Centre-s-Analysis
Performed analysis of historical data of Shopping Centes in Australia using Python and Power BI. This project is part of my internship at Reomnify as a Data Analyst and following are the tasks that I completed,

🔍 Data Analysis & Cleaning:
Utilized Python for initial analysis and cleaning dataset, identifying data quality issues like missing values, duplicates and other discrepancies; enhancing the overall accuracy of the dataset. Also utilized Power Query for data transformation and cleansing.

📊 Data Quality Dashboards:
Designed interactive dashboards in Power BI that tracked recurring data quality issues, helping the team monitor the issues within the updated datasets. 

🏢 Shopping Center Comparison:
Built dashboards to compare multiple shopping centers over different time periods. Developed calculated columns and measures using DAX to track store additions and removals at a centre, providing actionable insights into shopping center performance.

📌 Suburb & Store Analysis:
Conducted a suburb-level analysis to identify the most and least active cities based on store openings and closings, also visualizing trends in store categories and popular brands.
